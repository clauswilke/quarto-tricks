Don't forget that you need `wml2` and `downlit` packages install. 

Then your function name will become hyper links thanks to the `code-link` option!

```{r}
# Load the ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)
```

Let's try with a graph

```{r}
# Create the scatterplot using ggplot2
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Weight (1000 lbs)", y = "Miles per Gallon",
       title = "Scatterplot of MPG vs. Weight") +
  theme_minimal()
```
