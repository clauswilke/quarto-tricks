About Table of Content

It is pretty straightforward!

You just need `toc: true` in the header and then to include titles in the document.

# Plot 1

Running Code

When you click the Render button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
plot(1,1)
```

# Plot 2

A bit of code

```{r}
 #| echo: false
 2 * 2
```

Nice one isn't it! ðŸ™ƒ

# Conclustion

Pretty useful!
