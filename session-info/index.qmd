title: "Session Info"

At the end of a document, it is a good practive to use the `sessionInfo()` command to list of the packages in use and their version.

But the result is very verbose, and pretty ugly.

I suggest we wrap it in an accordion: it will be available but discrete.

<button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" >Session Information</button><div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse"><div>

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

</div></div>
