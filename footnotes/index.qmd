It is pretty straigthforward to add footnotes to a Quarto document.

For instance, here is one attached to the word carrot^[The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, typically orange in color]. 

And let's add a second one, about potatoes[^potatoNote]. This time an identifier is created and the footnote content is written below.

[^potatoNote]: The potato /pəˈteɪtoʊ/ is a starchy root vegetable native to the Americas that is consumed as a staple food in many parts of the world.
