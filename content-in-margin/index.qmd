Let's start by adding some R results in the margin. 

It is possible thanks to the `#| column: margin` chunk option.



```{r}
#| column: margin

knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:3, 1:3]
)
```

Not too bad!

Side notes are a very good way to make your doc shines!

You should use it.

Now, let's add some text / non R generated content in the margin!

Just a random few words:

::: {.column-margin}

Hi! I'm a side note! ðŸ”¥

:::

That's pretty much it. You can use markdown, equations, or any other HTML content in it!
