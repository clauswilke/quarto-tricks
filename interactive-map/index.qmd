Thanks to the [leaflet package](https://r-graph-gallery.com/package/leaflet.html), it is very straightforward to include an interactive map in a quarto document.

# First map

Let's load `leaflet` and build a very basic map with it to see how it looks like. \
\
Note: you need to install the package first with `install.packages()`

```{r}
#| column: screen
#| out-width: 100%

# Load the library.
library(leaflet)

# Make a map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>% # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng = 174.768, lat = -36.852, popup = "The birthplace of R")
```
# Pretty sweet

Looks not too bad ðŸ™‚.
