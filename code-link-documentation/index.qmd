With just one option in the quarto document header, you can link the code written in the report to the official documentation

In the code below, click on a function name!

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# Load dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# Example: Using dplyr to filter, select, and summarize data
mtcars_summary <- mtcars %>%
  # Filter rows where cars have 6 cylinders
  filter(cyl == 6) %>%
  # Select only the relevant columns: mpg (miles per gallon), hp (horsepower), and wt (weight)
  select(mpg, hp, wt) %>%
  # Create a summary of the average mpg, hp, and wt for these cars
  summarise(
    avg_mpg = mean(mpg),
    avg_hp = mean(hp),
    avg_wt = mean(wt)
  )
```
