It is possible to add a background image to the document header!

And here is some random content

# Plot 1

Running Code

When you click the Render button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
plot(1,1)
```

# Plot 2

A bit of code

```{r}
 #| echo: false
 2 * 2
```

Nice one isn't it! ðŸ™ƒ

# Conclustion

Pretty useful!
